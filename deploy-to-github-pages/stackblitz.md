# StackBlitz Instructions

Luckily since we are using StackBlitz there's no need to deploy the todo list app. We will rename your StackBlitz project and share the URL.

## Rename your project
Click on the pencil icon in the StackBlitz top menu bar. Rename the project to anything you like. We suggest `ng-girls-todo`. Click the save icon when complete.

## Share your project
Click on the **Share** button. The **APP URL** is the URL of your todo list app that you can share.
