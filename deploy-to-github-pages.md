# \#20: 🛰 Deploy to GitHub Pages

To deploy our changes to GitHub pages we will use the angular-cli-ghpages package [https://github.com/angular-schule/angular-cli-ghpages](https://github.com/angular-schule/angular-cli-ghpages)

* You need to have a GitHub user
* You need to create a repostiroy for your project.
* You need to commit all the changes you made in the project
* You need to install angular-cli-ghpages

## Creating a GitHub user

If you already have a GitHub user you can skip this step. To Create a GitHub user go to GitHub: [https://github.com/](https://github.com/) Fill the registration form and make sure to validate your email address.

## Create your App repository

After logging in to GitHub. Click on the `Start a project` button, and name the repository `ng-girls-todo` or any other name you like. 

***Tip*** GitHub Pages are case sensitive - it's the best to use lowercase letters in repository name.


## Connecting your repository

Commit all your changes by runing this command in your project directory.

```text
git add -A && git commit -m "Your Message"
```

Run the following command to connect your code to your repository. make sure to replace the {YOUR\_USERNAME} and {YOUR\_REPO} with your github username and repository name.

```text
git remote add origin https://github.com/{YOUR_USERNAME}/{YOUR_REPO}.git
git push -u origin master
```

## Deploying to GitHub Pages

First install angular-cli-ghpages.

```text
npm i -g angular-cli-ghpages
```

Then simply run:

```text
ng build --prod --base-href="/[your-repo-name]/"
angular-cli-ghpages --dir=dist/todo-list
```

Your app will be available at [https://[your-GH-username].github.io/[repo-name]/](https://[your-GH-username].github.io/[repo-name])

For more information see [https://github.com/angular-schule/angular-cli-ghpages](https://github.com/angular-schule/angular-cli-ghpages).

## Known Issues

### Blank screen (and 404 error in DevTools in Browser)
If deploy succedeed but you see blank page in browser you probably used capitalized letters in your repository name. Try to add new repository with only lowercase letters from GitHub website. Later on remove connection to old one from your local files by typing:
```
git remote rm
```
in terminal. Add connection to new repository
```
git remote add origin https://github.com/{YOUR_USERNAME}/{YOUR_REPO}.git
git push -u origin master
```
And build website again:
```
ng build --prod --base-href="/[your-repo-name]/"
angular-cli-ghpages --dir=dist/todo-list
```


### Problem on Windows
On \(windows\) machines you might run into an issue like the following:

```text
An error occurred!
 Error: Unspecified error (run without silent option for detail)
    at C:\Users\<myuser>\AppData\Roaming\nvm\v8.9.1\node_modules\angular-cli-ghpages\node_modules\gh-pages\lib\index.js:232:19
    at _rejected (C:\Users\<myuser>\AppData\Roaming\nvm\v8.9.1\node_modules\angular-cli-ghpages\node_modules\q\q.js:844:24)
    ...
```

Try to debug it with `angular-cli-ghpages -S` . If you get the following error:

```text
fatal: could not read Username for \'https://github.com\': No error\n',
```

you can do the following

1. Create a Personal Access Token here: [https://github.com/settings/tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens)
2. Run the following command and replace your token, organisation \(your user\), repository, username and email:

   ```text
   angular-cli-ghpages --repo=https://<personal-access-token>@github.com/organisation/your-repo.git --name="Displayed Username" --email=mail@example.org
   ```
