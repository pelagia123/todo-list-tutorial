# Photo gallery
We’re starting with simple photo gallery. To create it we need one service and two components. 

Photos service will start with one field: `photos`. It’s an array with a bunch of example photos. First we’re gonna use it to display our gallery. Later we’ll, gradually, add Observables and interactvity, based on this array with photos.

Our Photo interface looks like that:

```typescript
export interface Photo {
    url: string;
    description: string;
    id: string;
    categoryID?: string;
}
```

so `photos` in Photos service has type `Photo[]`. Gallery component refers photos list

```typescript
photosList: Photo[] = this.photosService.photos;
```

and displays it using `*ngFor*`

```html
<div class="photos-list">
    <div *ngFor="let photo of photosList" class="photo">
        <app-photo [photo]="photo"></app-photo>
    </div>
</div>
```

As you see there’s one component left to implement. `app-photo` that displays single photo. In component code we declare one `Input`

```typescript
@Input() photo: { description: string; };
```

and use this data in HTML template

```typescript
<img (click)="onPhotoClick(photo.id)" [src]="photo.url">
```


## First Observable!
Our photo gallery looks great, but all photos are so small. Users will want to see bigger pictures. Let’s help them do so! When users click on photo we’ll create a nice overlay over our gallery and show the whole photo.

To do it we have to track which photo is currently active. How do we do it? Of course, with help of Rx.js! It provides us with `BehaviorSubject` – object that holds value changing over time. Once we’ve had created BehaviorSubject that stores ID of active photo, we can display it easily.

```typescript
noPhotoID = ""
activePhotoID$ = new BehaviorSubject(this.noPhotoID)
```

As you see, BehaviorSubject constructor takes one argument – initial value. When we start to subscribe to activePhoto$ it will give us this value and, later, every next that comes to it. Our first value is empty string, since there’s no active photo when application starts.

Let’s now go to our gallery and change value of activePhotoID$ every time user clicks on photo.

```typescript
<img (click)="onPhotoClick(photo.id)" [src]="photo.url">
```

We already know what’s going on here. Once user clicks on photo, we’re going to call the `onPhotoClick` method with one argument: photo.id. How do we implement `onPhotoClick` to make sure it sends value to activePhotoID$? We can do so like this:

```typescript
onPhotoClick(photoID: string) {
    this.photosService.activePhotoID$.next(photoID)
}
```

Just refer the `activePhotoID$` and call `next` on it! Great! You’ve just connected user event with `Observable`. Now you can subscribe to it and display active photo.

# Creating new value from Observable
To display active photo let’s create a new component called (you guessed it) `active-photo`. It will access a photo that is currently active and display it.

But, you probably thinking now, in our photos service, we only store the ID of the photo. Our component needs entire Photo object! Let’s take our `activePhotoID$` and create new Observable out of it.

```typescript
activePhoto$: Observable<Photo> = this.activePhotoID$.pipe(
    map(photoID => this.photos.find(propEq("id", photoID))
)
```

Only three lines of code and we’re done! Let’s break down what happens in activePhoto$.

First: we’re accessing current active photo ID. Second: we’re using `pipe` method to transform it into something new. That’s what `pipe` does. It takes value from Observable and pipes it through Rx.js operators that create new Observables. Our first `pipe` takes photo ID and maps it to Photo object. Third: we take array of photos and return one Photo whose `id` equals `photoID`. Function `propEq` says exactly that: check if property named `id` equals variable `photoID`.

Let’s break this process down even further. Let’s extract a method that takes photo ID and returns Photo. It looks like this:

```typescript
findPhotoByID = (photos: Photo[], photoID: string) =>
    photos.find(propEq("id", photoID))
```

We’re just finding one photo in array. Now, move it back to our `activePhoto$` Observable.

```typescript
activePhoto$: Observable<Photo> = this.activePhotoID$.pipe(
    map(this.findPhotoByID)
)
```

Take active photo ID, pipe it through `map` operator and return new Observable that finds photo based on ID.

Go on and use `activePhoto$` Observable to display photo that user wanted to see!

## Display active photo!
It gets more and more interesting! You created `BehaviorSubject` that keeps value changing over time. You’ve used it to create new Observable! Now you get to display data from it. It surely requires a lot of work, or does it…? Let’s look at the code.

```typescript
activePhoto$: Observable<Photo> = this.photosService.activePhoto$;
```

```html
<div *ngIf="(activePhoto$ | async)" class="active-photo">
    <img [src]="(activePhoto$ | async)?.url">
</div>
```

And we have it with a couple lines of code! You assign `activePhoto$` from Photos service to Component field, so we can access `activePhoto$` value in HTML. Because we access asynchronous value that changes over time we use `async` pipe. Now Angular knows it should subscribe to asynchronous value and use new value every time it changes. Last part `?.url` means: check if `activePhoto$` holds a value, if it does access `url` field from it and display in HTML. Whew! We did it!

## Hiding active photo
Last thing to do is hiding photo! It’s nice that user can see bigger photos, but refreshing application every time one wants to change photo preview would be a little… cumbersome ;)

To hide active photo we need to put empty ID on `activePhotoID$` `BehaviorSubject`. This way Photos service will know to send our components `undefined` value through `activePhoto$` Observable and no photo will be displayed.

Ok, first let’s add `hidePhoto` handler to HTML element, like that:

```html
<div
    *ngIf="(activePhoto$ | async)"
    class="active-photo"
    (click)="hidePhoto()"
>
    <img [src]="(activePhoto$ | async)?.url">
</div>
```

Active photo is now ready to receive user clicks. Now we go to Component and implement our handler.

```typescript
hidePhoto() {
    this.photosService.activePhotoID$.next(this.photosService.noPhotoID);
}
```

Looks almost like setting active Photo ID, we’ve done in Photo Component. Only difference is, this time we’re sending `noPhotoID` instead of real ID. This way no active photo is displayed! What more can we do with our gallery? Maybe… let’s try adding some photos!
